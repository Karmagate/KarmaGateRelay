                      A "Relay Service" is a commercial offering that allows
                      third parties to access the functionality of the
                      Licensed Work by creating relay rooms, routing messages,
                      or providing collaboration infrastructure as a service.

                      For purposes of clarity, the following uses are
                      explicitly permitted:
                      - Self-hosting for your organization's internal use
                      - Modifying the source code for your own internal use
                      - Personal, educational, or research purposes
                      - Non-commercial open source projects

                      The following uses are explicitly prohibited:
                      - Offering the Licensed Work as a commercial relay or
                        collaboration service (whether paid or as part of a
                        paid offering)
                      - Incorporating the Licensed Work into a competing
                        commercial security testing product
